**I'm Marc, and I work in the pick up industry. **

That's a phrase the high school would be very shocked to hear. Like most men my age, I became interested in pickup when [Niel Strauss' the Game][0] was popular. Which frankly, has largely [maintained it's popularity][1] since it's 2006 debut. 

Following my own health start up-and fledgling career as a food photographer I took a career with [Jumpcut Studios][2], the production house responsible for [Simple Pickup][3]. 

Pickup is largely a hidden market, shying away from industry blogs, [large seminars][4] and masterminds. (Besides products meant for clients.)

My role as Chief of Staff at Jumpcut has afforded me the time and access to understand how Simple Pickup has risen from a collaboration of wabi-sabi college pickup guys to arguably the most well known pickup company in the world. And definitely the most well received. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cc0bf208-2301-45b9-b527-bd4055438d42.jpg)
