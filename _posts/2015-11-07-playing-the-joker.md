Playing the Joker.

There is a divide in pickup. You can be the joker, or be the [batman][0]. The market seems to favor the bag guys here, but what are the repercussions? 

"The Batman" are the rare pickup companies that promote positive self growth, positivity towards women, and posses an overall air of warmth. [Simple Pickup][1] is the obvious example here -- but also companies such as [Instaconnection][2] (an SP clone) and [Eric Disco][3]. Often times you'll come across the matra, "leave the girl better than you found here" within this group.

"The Joker" is not necessarily promoting the antithesis of the Batman, but rather promotes the idea of self growth as the exclusive motivator. These companies intentionally brand themselves as the villain, for various reasons, and have garnished a lot of media attention for doing so -- and by extension, clients. 

This villain branding isn't exaggerated, and is common place in the pickup industry. 

* [Vitaly][4] wears a hat with bold white writing, "VILLAIN" across the front.
* [Justin Wayne][5] will [tell women he loves][6] them as a method of his seduction. (The unspoken caveat: love, but not IN love.)
* [RSD's Julien Blanc][7] has been banned in various countries and leveraged this on media for viewership.
* [David Bond][8] exemplifies the Japanophile american who picks up asian girls. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/be14c1e3-4689-4658-9d2d-30e6dc2e9d99.jpg)

The prevailing view of the Joker is not much different from the films'. By accepting the RSD world view, [you should view yourself as a god][9]. The sub-communication here is clear.

We should note that the Joker works, and works well. Clients are drawn to to the Joker, perhaps because the he is so outside of their day to day monotony. It is a romantic notion.  After-all, it's almost always the badass' that get the most women. And the Villains_always_ have the most fun.

Looking beyond the value the Joker can provide to individuals business', what value or influence permeates the industry as a result?

1\. Due to the internationally negative reputation of pickup (due to the prevalence of the Joker), entering into the industry as a Batman or otherwise immediately tarnishes your reputation. 

Those who, had pickup not been under such scrutiny, would enter the market are persuaded not to. This means less competition, and even fewer Batmen. If you're in pickup you will wear the same cloak of infamy as everyone else.

The decision to enter the market is a permanent one. If you don't make it big, good luck in going back to your 9-5 job at AT&T after being [banned in various first world countries][10]. 

The worse reputation pickup has the more the established Jokers will thrive and prevent new companies from entering the space.

2\. The potential client pool will be restricted. Pick-up has analogies with hiring a prostitute. Once you buy dating a product or attend a bootcamp you've cross some invisible boundary which there is no return. 

A lot of people are willing to cross this line, but a lot arn't. Many men are willing to share pickup lines and techniques they got from friends but are less inclined to do so from dating companies. This means a client segment that wont even work with Batman.

> You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go 'according to plan.' Even if the plan is horrifying! - The Joker,  The Dark Knight.

Should the prevailing attitude of Pickup be a message of positivity this may not be the case. At the time of writing this article, it is.

Effectively it's the Online Dating mindset from the early 2000's. The content itself is good, but "where do we tell our friends we met?" However with Online Dating, unlike pickup, the [taboo][11] has largely disappeared revealing a [2b+ market][12]. Online dating just isn't weird now.

For pickup, it's unlikely that this happens any time soon. [It's still weird][13]. [It's still a black sheep][14]. And it's like this because of the Villain perpetuation. Regardless of whether you're with Batman or the Joker, you're still hiding in the shadows. 

With Pickup, there are no white knights.
